	 Mathematics is the music of reason.

	 B.1 Musimat
	 
	 Why did I invent a new programming language when there are so many excellent ones already 
	 available? The problem is that most programming languages are more general-purpose than is 
	 required for the relatively specialized purposes of this material, and a proper introduction to such 
	 a general-purpose language would lead the discussion too far afield. I decided it would be of more 
	 service to readers to specialize the language so that its features would match the examples in this 
	 book as closely as possible. That way, the focus would remain on the subject being coded rather 
	 than on the language being used to code it.
	 
	 Nevertheless, Musimat is similar to other procedural languages such as C or C++ (see Stroustrup 
	 1991), so if you already know one of these, it should be easy to pick up Musimat. If you don't 
	 know any programming language, learning one should be easier after you learn Musimat.
	 I present everything you'll need to know about Musimat in the following sections.
	 
	 NOTE: In fact, this version of Musimat is implemented in C++.
