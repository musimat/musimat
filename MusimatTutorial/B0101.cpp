	 B.1.1 Basic Elements
	 
	 Virtually all programming languages, including Musimat, share the following characteristics:
	 
	 o Flow control -- Specifying the order in which the steps are to be taken.
	 
	 o Data types -- Naming the kinds of objects to be operated on and describing their behaviors. Types 
	 of numbers, such as integer and real are common basic data types.
	 
	 o Variables -- Names of places to hold data of various types.
	 
	 o Operators -- A set of actions that can be performed on data. Operations like "add", "assign", and 
	 "select" perform well-defined operations on the data. 
	 
	 o Conditional evaluation -- Making decisions based on circumstances and taking appropriate 
	 action. 
	 
	 o Iteration -- If an algorithm is to be applied repeatedly to data, for instance, the way Euclid's 
	 method does, then we need a way to express this.
	 
	 o Recursion -- If a future output depends upon a current or previous output as well as possibly the 
	 current inputs, we say that the relationship is recursive.
	 
	 o Data structures -- It is sometimes necessary to group data into collections, such as sets, lists, 
	 arrays, and matrices. The types of these data structures can be homogeneous (all alike) or heter-
	 ogeneous (a mixed bag).
	 
	 o Named methods -- When we've developed a set of instructions that does something useful, we 
	 want to be able to give it a name, like "Euclid's method" or "Guido's method." Since programming 
	 languages developed out of the mathematics of functions, we use functional notation to represent 
	 the operation of methods.
