	 B.1.6 Reserved Words
	 
	 For the language to be unambiguous, we must reserve the meaning of certain words and symbols. 
	 Reserved words are distinguished by an initial capital letter. 
	 Musimat reserved words include If, While, Do, For, Repeat, Else, Halt, Real, Integer, 
	 Return. Later sections will describe their use.
	 
	 Some other symbols are also reserved. These symbols can't be used for anything but their 
	 designated meaning. We'll meet up with them as we go along.
